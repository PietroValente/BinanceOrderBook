# Binance Order Book
## Overview
The project consists in the local reconstruction of the BTC/USDT order book by leveraging Binance public APIs. The system retrieves real-time market data (depth snapshots and updates) and maintains an efficient local copy of the order book.

The goal of the project is to simulate the behavior of a trading platform's matching engine and provide a reliable and up-to-date view of the market for BTC/USDT.
